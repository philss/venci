# Venci

- Vim, vi, venci

My Vim configuration files

## Dependencies

- [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
- git

## How to install

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Them you need to open vim and run `:BundleInstall`. It will take some minutes depending of your connection.
After that, close and open your vim again. Everything should be fine.
